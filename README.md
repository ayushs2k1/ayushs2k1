### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who Am I?
My name is **Ayush Sharma**. I'm a 2nd year engineering student from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I started my coding journey in 2020. I used to do competitive coding in C/C++ language. After devoting a year, refining my skills in data structures and algorithms, in summer of 2020 I shifted my interest into the field of Data Science. Since then, I breathe data.

## What do I do?
Literally everything with data!! :blush:

In May, I did an internship and training program from IIT Kanpur on Machine learning for 3 months.
In October, I got my first independent research paper published in a journal [<img target="_blank" src="https://img.icons8.com/cute-clipart/32/000000/paper.png">](https://www.ijser.org/onlineResearchPaperViewer.aspx?A-Comparative-Study-on-Efficiencies-of-Variants-of-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-based-on-Image-Classification-Task.pdf) called IJSER in Volume 11, Issue 10, October 2020.

## Goals
My goal is to play around with datasets and create a lot of interesting projects, implement research papers and write blogs to help the community.
